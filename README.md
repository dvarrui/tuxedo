On Thursday, July 30, while writing, the D key is blocked.
I can only use the mouse and decide to turn off the computer.
The screen stays off but the light on the power led and the keyboard indicates that it is still on. Also, the bottom of the equipment is very hot.

Pressing the off button has no effect.
The computer stays like this for hours, until it runs out of battery.

The next day, it is already cold. I turn it on and it seems to work normally.
